Add the lines 

ServerActors=HGuard1_v5.HGServerActor
ServerPackages=HGuard1_v5

to the [Engine.GameEngine] section and copy the HGuard1_v4.u and the HGuard.ini file to the System directory. 

Note that if you are upgrading from an older version of HGuard, you MUST replace the HGuard.ini with the new one.
